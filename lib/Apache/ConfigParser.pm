=head1 NAME

Apache::ConfigParser - Load Apache configuration files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Apache::ConfigParser;

  # Create a new empty parser.
  my $c1 = Apache::ConfigParser->new;

  # Load an Apache configuration file.
  my $rc = $c1->parse_file('/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf');

  # If there is an error in parsing the configuration file, then $rc
  # will be false and an error string will be available.
  if (not $rc) {
    print $c1->errstr, "\n";
  }

  # Get the root of a tree that represents the configuration file.
  # This is an Apache::ConfigParser::Directive object.
  my $root = $c1->root;

  # Get all of the directives and starting of context's.
  my @directives = $root->daughters;

  # Get the first directive's name.
  my $d_name = $directives[0]->name;

  # This directive appeared in this file, which may be in an Include'd
  # file.
  my $d_filename = $directives[0]->filename;

  # And it begins on this line number.
  my $d_line_number = $directives[0]->line_number;

  # Find all the CustomLog entries, regardless of context.
  my @custom_logs = $c1->find_down_directive_names('CustomLog');

  # Get the first CustomLog.
  my $custom_log = $custom_logs[0];

  # Get the value in string form.
  $custom_log_args = $custom_log->value;

  # Get the value in array form already split.
  my @custom_log_args = $custom_log->get_value_array;

  # Get the same array but a reference to it.
  my $customer_log_args = $custom_log->value_array_ref;

  # The first value in a CustomLog is the filename of the log.
  my $custom_log_file = $custom_log_args->[0];

  # Get the original value before the path has been made absolute.
  @custom_log_args   = $custom_log->get_orig_value_array;
  $customer_log_file = $custom_log_args[0];

  # Here is a more complete example to load an httpd.conf file and add
  # a new VirtualHost directive to it.
  #
  # The Apache::ConfigParser object contains a reference to a
  # Apache::ConfigParser::Directive object, which can be obtained by
  # using Apache::ConfigParser->root.  The root node is a
  # Apache::ConfigParser::Directive which ISA Tree::DAG_Node (that is
  # Apache::ConfigParser::Directive's @ISA contains Tree::DAG_Node).
  # So to get the root node and add a new directive to it, it could be
  # done like this:

  my $c                = Apache::ConfigParser->new;
  my $rc               = $c->parse_file('/etc/httpd.conf');
  my $root             = $c->root;
  my $new_virtual_host = $root->new_daughter;
  $new_virtual_host->name('VirtualHost');
  $new_virtual_host->value('*');

  # The VirtualHost is called a "context" that contains other
  # Apache::ConfigParser::Directive's:

  my $server_name = $new_virtual_host->new_daughter;
  $server_name->name('ServerName');
  $server_name->value('my.hostname.com');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Apache::ConfigParser> module is used to load an Apache
configuration file to allow programs to determine Apache's
configuration directives and contexts.  The resulting object contains
a tree based structure using the C<Apache::ConfigParser::Directive>
class, which is a subclass of C<Tree::DAG_node>, so all of the methods
that enable tree based searches and modifications from
C<Tree::DAG_Node> are also available.  The tree structure is used to
represent the ability to nest sections, such as <VirtualHost>,
<Directory>, etc.

Apache does a great job of checking Apache configuration files for
errors and this modules leaves most of that to Apache.  This module
does minimal configuration file checking.  The module currently checks
for:

=over 4

=item Start and end context names match

The module checks if the start and end context names match.  If the
end context name does not match the start context name, then it is
ignored.  The module does not even check if the configuration contexts
have valid names.

=back

=head1 PARSING

Notes regarding parsing of configuration files.

Line continuation is treated exactly as Apache 1.3.20.  Line
continuation occurs only when the line ends in [^\\]\\\r?\n.  If the
line ends in two \'s, then it will replace the two \'s with one \ and
not continue the line.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are available:

=over 4

=item $c = Apache::ConfigParser->new

=item $c = Apache::ConfigParser->new({options})

Create a new C<Apache::ConfigParser> object that stores the content of
an Apache configuration file.  The first optional argument is a
reference to a hash that contains options to new.

The currently recognized options are:

=over 4

=item pre_transform_path_sub => sub { }

=item pre_transform_path_sub => [sub { }, @args]

This allows the file or directory name for any directive that takes
either a filename or directory name to be transformed by an arbitrary
subroutine before it is made absolute with ServerRoot.  This
transformation is applied to any of the directives that appear in
C<%Apache::ConfigParser::Directive::directive_value_takes_path> that
have a filename or directory value instead of a pipe or syslog value,
i.e. "| cronolog" or "syslog:warning".

If the second form of C<pre_transform_path_sub> is used with an array
reference, then the first element of the array reference must be a
subroutine reference followed by zero or more arbitrary arguments.
Any array elements following the subroutine reference are passed to
the specified subroutine.

The subroutine is passed the following arguments:

  Apache::ConfigParser object
  lowercase string of the configuration directive
  the file or directory name to transform
  @args

NOTE: Be careful, because this subroutine will be applied to
ServerRoot and DocumentRoot, among other directives.  See
L<Apache::ConfigParser::Directive> for the complete list of directives
that C<pre_transform_path_sub> is applied to.  If you do not want the
transformation applied to any specific directives, make sure to check
the directive name and if you do not want to modify the filename,
return the subroutine's third argument.

If the subroutine returns an undefined value or a value with 0 length,
then it is replaced with <File::Spec->devnull> which is the
appropriate 0 length file for the operating system.  This is done to
keep a value in the directive name since otherwise the directive may
not work properly.  For example, with the input

  CustomLog logs/access_log combined

and if C<pre_transform_path_sub> were to replace 'logs/access_log'
with '', then

  CustomLog combined

would no longer be a valid directive.  Instead,

  CustomLog C<File::Spec->devnull> combined

would be appropriate for all systems.

=item post_transform_path_sub => sub { }

=item post_transform_path_sub => [sub { }, @args]

This allows the file or directory name for any directive that takes
either a filename or directory name to be transformed by this
subroutine after it is made absolute with ServerRoot.  This
transformation is applied to any of the directives that appear in
C<%Apache::ConfigParser::Directive::directive_value_takes_path> that
have a filename or directory value instead of a pipe or syslog value,
i.e. "| cronolog" or "syslog:warning".

If the second form of C<post_transform_path_sub> is used with an array
reference, then the first element of the array reference must be a
subroutine reference followed by zero or more arbitrary arguments.
Any array elements following the subroutine reference are passed to
the specified subroutine.

The subroutine is passed the following arguments:

  Apache::ConfigParser object
  lowercase version of the configuration directive
  the file or directory name to transform
  @args

NOTE: Be careful, because this subroutine will be applied to
ServerRoot and DocumentRoot, among other directives.  See
L<Apache::ConfigParser::Directive> for the complete list of directives
that C<post_transform_path_sub> is applied to.  If you do not want the
transformation applied to any specific directives, make sure to check
the directive name and if you do not want to modify the filename,
return the subroutine's third argument.

If the subroutine returns an undefined value or a value with 0 length,
then it is replaced with <File::Spec->devnull> which is the
appropriate 0 length file for the operating system.  This is done to
keep a value in the directive name since otherwise the directive may
not work properly.  For example, with the input

  CustomLog logs/access_log combined

and if C<post_transform_path_sub> were to replace 'logs/access_log'
with '', then

  CustomLog combined

would no longer be a valid directive.  Instead,

  CustomLog C<File::Spec->devnull> combined

would be appropriate for all systems.

=back

One example of where the transformations is useful is when the Apache
configuration directory on one host is NFS exported to another host
and the remote host parses the configuration file using
C<Apache::ConfigParser> and the paths to the access logs must be
transformed so that the remote host can properly find them.

configuration file was loaded either with new or parse_file and the
configuration file did not close all of its contexts, such as
<VirtualHost>, then the new configuration directives and contexts in
C<$filename> will be added to the existing context.

=item $c->root

Returns the root of the tree that represents the Apache configuration
file.  Each object here is a C<Apache::ConfigParser::Directive>.

=cut

sub root {

}

=item $c->find_down_directive_names('directive', ...)

=item $c->find_down_directive_names($node, 'directive', ...)

In list context, returns the list all of C<$c>'s directives that match
the directive names in C<$node> and C<$node>'s children.  In scalar
context, returns the number of such directives.  The level here is in
a tree sense, not in the sense that some directives appear before or
after C<$node> in the configuration file.  If C<$node> is given, then
the search searches C<$node> and C<$node>'s children.  If C<$node> is
not passed as an argument, then the search starts at the top of the
tree and searches the whole configuration file.

The search for matching directive names is done without regards to
case.

This is useful if you want to find all of the CustomLog's in the
configuration file:

  my @logs = $c->find_down_directive_names('CustomLog');

=cut

sub find_down_directive_names {
  unless (@_ > 1) {
    confess "$0: Apache::ConfigParser::find_down_directive_names ",

  $start->walk_down({callback => $callback});

  @found;
}

=item $c->find_siblings_directive_names('directive', ...)

=item $c->find_siblings_directive_names($node, 'directive', ...)

In list context, returns the list of all C<$c>'s directives that match
the directive names at the same level of C<$node>, that is siblings of
C<$node>.  In scalar context, returns the number of such directives.
The level here is in a tree sense, not in the sense that some
directives appear above or below C<$node> in the configuration file.
If C<$node> is passed to the method and it is equal to C<$c-E<gt>tree>
or if C<$node> is not given, then the method will search through
root's children.

This method will return C<$node> as one of the matches if C<$node>'s
directive name is one of the directive names passed to the method.

The search for matching directive names is done without regards to
case.

=item $c->find_siblings_and_up_directive_names($node, 'directive', ...)

In list context, returns the list of all C<$c>'s directives that match
the directive names at the same level of C<$node>, that is siblings of
C<$node> and above C<$node>.  In scalar context, returns the number of
such directives.  The level here is in a tree sense, not in the sense
that some directives appear before or after C<$node> in the
configuration file.  In this method C<$node> is a required argument
because it does not make sense to check the root node.  If C<$node>
does not have a parent node, then no siblings will be found.  This
method will return C<$node> as one of the matches if C<$node>'s
directive name is one of the directive names passed to the method.

The search for matching directive names is done without regards to
case.

This is useful when you find an directive and you want to find an
associated directive.  For example, find all of the CustomLog's and
find the associated ServerName.

  foreach my $log_node ($c->find_down_directive_names('CustomLog')) {
    my $log_filename = $log_node->name;
    my @server_names = $c->find_siblings_and_up_directive_names($log_node);

=item $c->errstr

Return the error string associated with the last failure of any
C<Apache::ConfigParser> method.  The string returned is not emptied
when any method calls succeed, so a non-zero length string returned
does not necessarily mean that the last method call failed.
