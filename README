INSTALLATION

In order to use this package you will need Perl version 5.004_05 or
better.  Once that is completed, you install Apache::ConfigParser as you
would install any perl module library, by running these commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you want to install a private copy of this package in some other
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

    perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl

DOCUMENTATION

See the CHANGES file for a list of recent changes.  POD style
documentation is included in all modules and scripts.  These are
normally converted to manual pages end installed as part of the "make
install" process.  You should also be able to use the 'perldoc'
utility to extract documentation from the module files directly.
